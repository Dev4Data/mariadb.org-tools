MariaDB includes a User Feedback plugin. This plugin is disabled by
default. If enabled, it submits basic, completely anonymous MariaDB
usage information. This information is used by the developers to
track trends in MariaDB usage to better guide development efforts.

If you would like to help make MariaDB better, please add
"feedback=ON" to your my.cnf or my.ini file!

See http://mariadb.com/kb/en/user-feedback-plugin for more
